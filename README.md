## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your Swarm modules directory (typically /opt/perforce/swarm/module):
```bash
cd modules
git clone [repository-url] SlackNotify
```

2. Add the module to your Swarm configuration (`config/custom.modules.config.php`):
```php
<?php
\Laminas\Loader\AutoloaderFactory::factory(
    array(
        'Laminas\Loader\StandardAutoloader' => array(
            'namespaces' => array(
                // ... other modules ...
                'SlackNotify'       => BASE_PATH . '/module/SlackNotify/src',
            )
        )
    )
);
return [
    // ... other modules ...
    'SlackNotify',
];
```

3. Copy the example configuration and adjust as needed:
```bash
cp /opt/perforce/swarm/module/slack-notify/config/module.config.php.example /opt/perforce/swarm/module/slack-notify/config/slack-notify.config.php
```

4. Delete cache
```bash
rm -rf /opt/perforce/swarm/data/cache
```
## Configuration

The module requires the following configuration in your Swarm settings:

```php
[
    'slack' => [
        // OAuth token for your Slack app (Found in OAuth & Permissions after installing the Slack, more details: https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2)
        'token' => 'xoxb-your-token-here',
        
        // Channel for new review notifications
        'notify_channel' => 'swarm-reviews',
        
        // Cache time for user mappings (in seconds)
        'user_cache_ttl' => 3600,
    ]
]
```

### Required Slack App Permissions

Your Slack app needs the following OAuth scopes:

- chat:write - Send messages as @SwarmNotifier.
- chat:write.public - Send messages to channels where @SwarmNotifier isnâ€™t a member.
- im:write - Start direct messages with users.
- users:read - View user information in the workspace.
- users:read.email - Look up users by their email address
